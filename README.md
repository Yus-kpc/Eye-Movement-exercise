# Eye movement exercise
This is another project called eye movement exercise that I completed for my course. The eye in the middle of the screen is programmed so that the eye ball follows the pointer when it is moved around on screen.

# How to run
After loading the page, you can simply move the mouse around the eye to see the eyeball follow the pointer.

# Roadmap of future developments
One more eye is to be added so the screen will have two eyes, just like us!
